        "Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that has been getting a lot of popularity recently due to its effectiveness and applicability in real world combat.\n",
        "\n",
        "As someone who has been practicing it for quite a while now this martial art I wanted to investigate if I could use machine learning to help me improve my jiu jitsu abilities. Therefore, I decided to turn to pose estimation as a technique that shows a lot of promise as a complimentary tool for practioners of all sorts of sports and martial arts including jiu jitsu.\n",

        "# Why Pose Tracking for Jiu Jitsu?\n",
        "\n",
        "I've been a practioner of brazilian jiu jitsu for over 10 years now. Having recently gotten my black belt, I felt really excited to join my interests in martial arts and machine learning to try and come up with a project that lived at the intersection of these 2 really interesting fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, for those of you who are unaware, pose tracking is the process of using computer vision models to obtain the key points of the body joints obtained from a video (leveraging object detection models and other advanced techniques).\n",
        "\n",
        "Jiu jitsu is a martial art that is largely based on its practioner's ability to perform and execute techniques to perfection. Such a demand can sometimes mean a great deal of frustration for people that struggle in executing certain types of movements. Usually, in the normal environment of a jiu jitsu gym, the black belt coach will give the feedback to the student regarding the appropriateness of his or her execution of the technique. However, its often the case that people want to learn how to perform certain movements but either don't have the access to an expert, or the class contains too many students and it becomes difficult for the person conducting the class to give specific and personal feedback regarding whether or not the student is performing the movements correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this potential gap of feedback is that I think tools like pose tracking can greatly benefit the world of martial arts in general and jiu jitsu in particular (although one can argue the same for Judo, Wrestling and striking-based martial arts as well). \n",
        "\n",
        "The form of this feedback is something that would have to be developed, and this article is an attempt to provide directions for how such a machine learning based feedback system would work for helping students get better at performing foundational movements in the sport."

        "# Why Did I Do This?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ok, so here is the story.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are unfamiliar with Jiu Jitsu, let me give you the quick rundown of how it works. \n",
        "\n",
        "Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that focuses on grappling and ground fighting techniques. It was developed in Japan and later modified and popularized in Brazil. But now, it has spread all over the world due to its increase in popularity particularly in the United States.\n",
        "The basic principle of Jiu Jitsu is that a smaller, weaker person can defend against a larger, stronger opponent by using leverage and technique. Jiu Jitsu practitioners aim to control their opponent's body and position themselves into a dominant position where they can execute techniques such as chokes, joint locks, and throws. Jiu Jitsu is now a popular sport and self-defense system practiced all over the world. It requires physical and mental discipline, as well as a willingness to learn and adapt. Jiu Jitsu has also been found to have numerous benefits, including improved physical fitness and mental acuity, increased confidence and self-esteem, and stress relief. \n",
        "\n",
        "Usually when you develop your jiu jitsu skills, you end up falling under one of 2 categories: bottom player, or top player. That means whether you tend to play from the bottom using your \"guard\" (a reference to the usage of the legs to perform attacks on the opponent)\n",
        "or from top by first taking down your opponent and then proceding to pass the line of their legs to (usually) reach one of a dominant position like being mounted on your opponent or taking his back. \n",
        "\n",
        "Such a duality is obviously artificial, and usually most experienced players can play both positions extremely well. However, it is the case that people tend to lean towards preferences in the beggining of their journey in jiu jitsu, and that can hugely impact their progress in other areas if they get stuck executing the same strategy over and over. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a way, thats what happened to me, I used to fight a lot as a guard player, due to a predominant culture in Brazil that fosters starting the grappling bouts from the knees to avoid either injuries and because the mat space is not big enough like Wrestling mats in big High School Gyms in the US. This habit of sitting down and fighting from the back willingly without my opponent actually having to take me down, had a negative impact in my development as a martial artist, because as I became better and better at Jiu Jitsu, I realized that one thing holding up my development was indeed my lack of high level knowledge on how to take people down.\n",
        "\n",
        "This ignited a fire in me to start working more from standing position, and I went on to study and practice Wrestling and Judo when I was a couple of years into my brown belt. Over the last 2 years I have been mostly a bottom player, and indeed improved quite a bit my ability to take people to the ground. However, there are certain foundational movements in Judo for example that are extremely difficult to develop, and because I don't know any Judo experts, nor do I live close to any high level Judo or Wrestling gym, I realized that I needed another way to improve certain Judo based movements for Jiu Jitsu, specifically a movement called \"The Uchimata\".\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
